  <h4>The Concept</h4>
</div>

**SOLAS** (meaning *Light* in Irish) is an open-source ray tracing code developed to analyze emission line profiles in transient astronomical events.

Currently in development, **SOLAS** will soon release a minimal viable product, building on the legacy of [*escatter.py*](https://github.com/Astro-Sean/escatter).

  <h4>Challenges in Transient Astronomy</h4>
</div>

Most existing tools for studying transient events assume spherical symmetry, which fails to represent the highly asymmetric nature of these explosions. While several codes can model these phenomena, **SOLAS** aspires to be the first open-source, user-friendly tool that effectively incorporates the complexities of asymmetry in transient events.

  <h4>Features Under Development</h4>
</div>

- Trace a photon from its emission at the photosphere through an intervening medium, capturing scattering, emission, and absorption events.
- Generate detailed emission and absorption line profiles to analyze the intervening material and, crucially, its geometry.
- Position an "observer" at various orientations to assess light-of-sight effects.
- Utilize your own models—if you have data on the location of your photosphere, along with the density, distribution, and temperature of the intervening material—to explore potential emergent profiles.
